 What is sealed class/method in C# and how does it affect inheritance?

 Ans : The sealed keyword prevents a class from being inherited or a method from being overridden. 

 sealed class FinalClass
{
    public void Method() { }
}

class Derived : FinalClass // ‚ùå Compile-time error
{
}

Useful for security, performance, or finalizing APIs.
